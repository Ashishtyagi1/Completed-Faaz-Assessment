Thank you for giving me an opportunity to showcase my coding skills.

I have tried to cover all the requirements and functionalities mentioned in the task.
However, I would like to explain a bit about all the functionalities I have added and their usage.

The requirement was to use the data provided and display that in form of a table and provide few filters and sorting
functionalities.

I have tried to make the table presentable but didn't tried to put extra focus on designing part of the project,
I could have made the table or the project more attractive but since I think more focus is on the functionalities, 
I have tried to stay focused on that.

I have made a table showcasing the provided data with following functionalities:

1. I have applied pagination to the table in such a way that initially user can see only 10 entries per page.
   User can switch pages and see entries on the next and previous page as well(if available).
   User can also update the number of entries displayed per page at any time as per his/her choice.

2. User can sort the data based on any of the labels, he/she just have to click on the label in the header of the
    table and the data would be sorted based on that particular label. The initial requirement was to provide sorting
    functionality based on the time but I have provided that for all labels.

3. There were 2 filter requirements, one was filtering data with a date range filter and other was by searching the
    description text. For that I have given a Filter Icon on the right end of the table header.
    By clicking on that icon user will get two option, either filter by text search or by date range.
    User can make the selection and filter the data accordingly.

4. I have displayed limited details of the transactions initially and provided a "view details" button at the end of
    each row. User can click on that text button and can see a dialog or popup to view the complete details of that
    particular transaction.

5. I have tried to refactor my codes and split the codes into various folders and files for better understanding.

6. First bonus point was to use typescript for type check, Instead I have user PropTypes to do that, I think that
    might work just fine and fullfil the requirement.

7. For second bonus point I have used Jest to write a few test cases. For this project there could be a lots of test
    cases, so I have just wrote down a couple to give you an idea and a view to evaluate. The evaluator might have to check the proper installation of the tool as in my case I was unable to get the proper version of the tool
    installed as there were other projects installed in my system which were using other configurations, so I request
    the evaluator to do the needful to successful run the project and allow the tool used to run.

8. I have also used Redux toolkit initially to create a store and store the data or API data in that and fetch it 
    from various components to use them as per the requirement.

Once again I would like to thank Faaz for this opportunity.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
